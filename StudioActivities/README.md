Welcome to Primo RPA Learning!

It is recommended to download the materials as an archive rather than as separate processes because some projects may include additional resources (Excel files, test applications, etc.) that are essential for certain workflows to function properly.

These projects are developed in PRO mode within the Studio and utilize the **Sequence process** type.
